First Intermediate Front-End Development Project through Free Code Camp.

Two obligations needed to be fulfilled. (1) User can press a button and view a random quote (2) User can press a button to tweet quote. 

Challenges to this project was altering the format of the quotes I used in order to successfully tweet them. The formating of the quotes from the API I used had many special character's that need to be encoded such as brackets, colons, and semi-colons as well as extra spaces and carriage returns that made the formating look bad after pressing the tweet button. My problems were solved using commands like encodeURIComponent(), replace(), and trim().
