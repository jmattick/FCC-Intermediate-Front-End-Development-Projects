<h1>Random Quote Machine</h1>

Project completed from Free Code Camp. View Here: http://codepen.io/jmatty16/full/ZpKRXV/

Two obligations needed to be fulfilled. (1) User can press a button and view a random quote (2) User can press a button to tweet quote. 

Challenges to this project was altering the format of the quotes I used in order to successfully tweet them. My problems were solved using commands like encodeURIComponent(), replace(), and trim().
