First Intermediate Front-End Development Project through Free Code Camp.

Two obligations needed to be fulfilled. (1) User can press a button and view a random quote (2) User can press a button to tweet quote. 

Challenges to this project was altering the format of the quotes I used in order to successfully tweet them. The formating of the quotes from the API I used had many special character's that need to be encoded such as brackets, colons, and semi-colons as well as extra spaces and carriage returns that affected the formating of the tweet. My problems were solved using commands like encodeURIComponent(), replace(), and trim().
