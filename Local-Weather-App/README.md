<h1>Local Weather App</h1>

Second Intermediate Front-End Development Project through Free Code Camp. 

There were three Objectives to complete. (1) User must be able to see the weather in their current location (2) User can see a different icon or image depending on the weather (3) User can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

Since the newest season of Rupaul's Drag Race is coming out this week, I chose to make my weather app Drag Queen themed. I chose to use GIFs from RuPaul's Drag Race to represent the weather rather than icons. This project really helped increase my ability to use APIs and JSON. Some challenges I faced from using GIFs was that codepen had trouble linking to GIFs from some sources so I had to use GIFs from other sources. If I were to make this app seriously I wouldn't use GIFs hosted elsewhere on the internet. 
<h2> As of June 2017 codepen is no longer compatible with the API I used to create this project </h2>
