<h1> Twitch.tv App </h1>
View here: https://codepen.io/jmattick/full/owvMZE/

App that lets you view free code camp's Twitch.tv users and select for their status. There were four objectives: (1) I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv. (2) I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel. (3) if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.(4) I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed).

For this project, I solidified my json skills. I used two json calls within a for loop to get all the necessary infomation using the twitch API. Future versions will have improved appearance and animations.
