<h1>Wikipedia Viewer</h1>

View Here: https://codepen.io/jmatty16/full/Lywwzw/

There were two obligations for this project. 

(1) I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.

(2) I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

While working on this project I discovered that some of my styling of the page was interfering with functionality of my Javascript. I was sure that my Javascript was correct but my wikipedia viewer was not working. So I copied my Javascript into a new project and created a barebones html framework and my viewer immediately started working. From this project, I learned to get the Javascript working before styling the page. In the future I would like to improve the appearance of this project.
